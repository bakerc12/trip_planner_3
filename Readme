this is a simple trip planner that I made for a school project.
the features of this trip planner are
1. a daily budget calculator
2. a converter that changes the area of a country from kilometers squared to miles squared
3. a simple timezone converter
4. a currency converter from USD to any other currency
some instruction for the code include
1. to not use any other symbols other than numbers, spaces or letters
2. you have to find the conversions rates for currency
